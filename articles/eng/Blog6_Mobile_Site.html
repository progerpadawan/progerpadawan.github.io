      "Mobile Site"</h2>

      <p>
        I was doing a mobile version of the xxx website and ran into a couple of things, <br>
        that I'd like to talk about: <br>
        In a few words, the app sends and receives reqests to the server, <br>
        and then reads and writes the data into the database. <br>
        <br>
        I use the HTTP library <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/volley" target="_blank">volley</a> to send the requests, it makes working with requests easier and faster. <br>
        The first thing I encountered is that volley caches requests, which is quite a hindrance to development. <br>
        Because despite the changes in the request code, the response is still the same and inexperience you might think, <br>
        that the changes don't work. <br>
        You have to restart the virtual device (cold boot) or remove the application on the physical one, <br>
        or you can disable caching during development. <pre><code class="java">request.setShouldCache(false);</code></pre>
        Next, the problems on the side of the site.<br>
        The site was created about 10 years ago, written in php and of course the external client was not planned. <br>
        Therefore, in order to make the android app work with the site, I had to change the site itself. <br>
        <br>
        First. <br>
        Identity in php sends a form with login/registration data. <br>
        Then php accepts the form, extracts the data and works with it. <br>
        The thing is, if js has a FormData() object, then java doesn't know how to send forms. <br>
        The exchange can be json`, and you can't get the data being sent through the $_POST variable <br>
        And the site has to take the data directly from the php://input file and convert it to a string: <pre><code class="php">file_get_contents('php://input');</code></pre>
        When identified, php creates or resumes a session cookie:PHPSESSID=xxx with session_start(). <br>
        But android is a cookie-less client, that is, it does not generate cookies. <br>
        So we have to save server-generated cookies into a database and send them between the client and the server. <br>
        <br>
        These are the problems I encountered in creating xxx. <br>
        Perhaps some of the solutions are not the best, but they came to mind and I have implemented them. <br>
        Thank you for your attention. <br>
